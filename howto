The Procedure is as follows,

Step 1: Edit the file common.h ,fill in the corresponding IPv4 address
  	edit the line 
	#define SERVER_IP "<your server IP here>"

step 2: Compile the required executables by giving the following commands

	#make adapter

	#make x86_server	

	if server runs on ARM kit then
	#make arm_server

	#make client

step 3: Since Program uses a non standard port, we need to modify the firewall rules 
	so either "Method 1" or "Method 2" should be good.
	
	Method 1:
	in GNOME from the system drop down menu:
		System -> Administration -> Security Level and Firewall
		select tab  "Firewall options" -> "other ports"
		then add port 55555 udp

	Method 2: (Not a Safe Option) Disable the firewall
		To stop the firewall for kernel 2.6
		# /etc/init.d/iptables save
		# /etc/init.d/iptables stop
	
		To start the firewall
		# /etc/init.d/iptables start

Step 4: Generation of .hct files for each remote(RC 6 mode 0)
	use adapter executable to generate .hct files (hct files are look up table for a remote, 
	each remote ill have its own hct file) 

	#./adapter 
	and foll the procedure give \stop to come out of the program

Step 5: Copy the client program and hct files to any system on the network (see man scp)
	and run the server on the machine with specified IP address

	to login:
		# ./client -i

	to logout:
		# ./client -o

	to send requests to the server:
		# ./client -d <device_name> -c <command> 
		repetation factor is optional (NOTE: repetation fator takes input in HEX)

	NOTE: If there is no activity on a client side, the server will automatically logout the 
	      corresponding user after a time interval of MAX_TIMER (defined in server.c)
